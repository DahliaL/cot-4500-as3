# Dahlia's COT4500 Assignment 1

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)
My submission for COP4500 Assignment 1. 

# How To Run
In the command prompt/terminal, make sure you are in the correct directory, the cot-4500-as1 folder. Then write the following commands (depending on whether the pip or python3 command works on your system):
##### Pip Execution
```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  pip src/main/assignment_3.py
```
##### Python3 Execution
```
  python3 install -r requirements.txt
  python3 src/main/assignment_3.py
```

The first command will install third-party libraries necessary for the program to run successfully, more specifically numpy. This does so by finding the requirements.txt file and installing the libraries (and their versions).  

The second command compiles and runs the program.

The program will run on its own after.
